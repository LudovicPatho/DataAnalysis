# Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to this repository!

## About
Physicist, just fascinated by the field of Data Science and its endless possibilities.

## Courses
I'm learning Data Science techniques mainly from online ressources such as blog posts, learning platforms such as [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org), [Dataquest.io](http://www.dataquest.io), [Datacamp](http://www.datacamp.com) and others ([Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com), [DataWorld](http://data.world), etc.).
The training exercises are gathered in the [Courses folder](_Courses/) for reference.

## Projects
Are also gathered here some projects applying the ML techniques learned throughout the courses.  Here is a summarized list of techniques I had the opportunity to apply on various datasets:
- Statistics: Hypothesis testing, Regularized Linear & Logistic Regression (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet)
- Supervised Machine Learning: Decision Trees, kNN, Random Forests, SVM
- Unsupervised Machine Learning: K Means & Hierarchical Clustering, Dimension reduction (PCA, TruncateSVD, NMF)
- Deep learning/Neural Networks: Forward/Backward prop, ReLu, Gradient descent, Keras, optimization methods
- Network analysis with NetworkX
- Natural Language Processing: Text tokenization using NLTK

See the [Projects](_Projects/README.md) for more detailed information.

## Certification
To account for the various trainings followed, I'm gathering all the certificates earned through hard labor in the [Certification folder](_Certifications).
