# Data Science Portfolio

## About
Physicist, just fascinated by the field of Data Science and its endless possibilities.

## Courses
I'm learning Data Science techniques mainly from online ressources such as blog posts, learning platforms such as [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org), [Dataquest.io](http://www.dataquest.io), [Datacamp](http://www.datacamp.com) and others ([Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com), [DataWorld](http://data.world), etc.).
The training exercises are gathered in the [Courses folder](_Courses/) for reference.

## Projects
Are also gathered here some projects applying the ML techniques learned on various datasets.  
See the [Project folder](_Projects/README.md) for more information.

## Certification
To account for the various trainings followed, I'm gathering all the certificates earned through hard labor in the [Certification folder](_Certifications).
